  <p>The world houses more than 7.7 Billion people
  <p>Pop culture has regularly compared the growth of our species to that of a uncontrollable Virus,
  <p>constantly growing without concern of natural resources or available space.
  <p>But there are many limiting factors that will prevent the Human species from constantly increasing
  <p>Limited Access to resources, man-made wars, and limiting reproduction are a few ways that
  <p>the human population is already limiting this supposed unlimited growth.
  <p>This sun burst chart that demonstrates the worlds over-all population
  <p>diluted down to the percentage of each continent and each country.</p>

  <P>Money can be a major factor of a population's growth, lifespan, and overall well being
  <p>Money represents that limited resources that we mentioned on the previous page.
  <p>We can make this assumption since Money/currency/dinero can be used to allocate food, water, shelter, etc.
  <p>All of which are resources that can be consumed, or used up, by human beings.</p>

  <p>We can interactively see how a country's wealth can have a direct effect on their life expectancy.
  <p>As we can see in the visual below, it was not until after the 1970s that we transitioned from having
  <p>the majority of the population being extremely under privileged.</p>

  <h1>Don't Go Breaking My Heart</h1>
  <p>One of the biggest ways we can see if a population is increasing or decreasing is by viewing its fertility rate.
  <p>This value is measured by the average of children each woman has in their life time.
  <p>In the graphic above, we can see how the increased use of contraceptives can lower the average fertility of individual countries.
  <p>In countries where contraceptives are less prevalent, fertility rates peaks at just under 8 births per woman.
  <p>On the opposite end of the spectrum, there are countries where 96% of the population uses some form of contraceptives,
  <p>and their fertility rates are drastically lower because of it.</p>

  <p>Besides proving that contraceptives work, this graphic also allows us to see its effect on fertility rates.</p>

  <h1>War, What is it Good For?</h1>
  <p>In the graphic below we can see how much death has been caused by Wars across the Globe
  <p>The Region that has been hit the hardest is Oceanic, which includes Australia, Philippines Pacific Islands, etc.
  <p>Some the highest recorded death rates occurred in Asia.
  <p>We can see certain peaks during the 1950s, at the beginning of the Korean War
  <p>And another precipice around the 1970s, which is when the Vietnam War was raging.
  <p>Although this is Man made destruction, it also represents an important limiting factor regarding population growth across the world. </p>

  <h1>Hey World (Don't Give Up)</h1>
  <p>In the graphic below, we can see each country's Population, Fertility, and Average Lifespan.
  <p>We can use this statistic to see where growth is being inhibited,
  <p>Where average lifespan is exceeding our expectations,
  <p>And where the highest populated areas around the globe are.
  <p>Even though there are many limiting factors on the population,
  <p>this graphic shows the growth that the world has experienced across the last 60 years.</p>
